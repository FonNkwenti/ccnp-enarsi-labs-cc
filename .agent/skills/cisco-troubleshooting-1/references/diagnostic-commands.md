# Phase III: Diagnostic Execution — Full Reference

## Connecting to GNS3 Routers via Netmiko

Use this pattern to connect to any router. Console ports come from the workbook's Console Access Table.

```python
from netmiko import ConnectHandler

conn = ConnectHandler(
    device_type="cisco_ios_telnet",
    host="127.0.0.1",
    port=5001,          # Console port from workbook
    username="",
    password="",
    secret="",
    timeout=10,
)

output = conn.send_command("show ip route")
print(output)
conn.disconnect()
```

For interactive troubleshooting, connect directly via telnet:
```bash
telnet localhost 5001   # R1
telnet localhost 5002   # R2
```

## Gathering Evidence from Both Sides

For adjacency or reachability issues, always connect to both sides:

```bash
# Check OSPF neighbor state on both sides
telnet localhost 5001   # R1 — show ip ospf neighbor
telnet localhost 5002   # R2 — show ip ospf neighbor
```

Compare outputs side-by-side to identify mismatches (timers, authentication, area IDs, network statements, K-values, etc.).

---

## Baseline Comparison Pattern

| Source | Use For |
|--------|---------|
| `initial-configs/[device].cfg` | What was pre-configured (starting state) |
| `solutions/[device].cfg` | What the correct end-state should look like |
| `workbook.md` Verification section | Expected `show` command outputs |

Cross-reference live output against these files to identify what is missing or wrong.

## Evidence Table Template

| Component | Expected | Observed | Status |
|-----------|----------|----------|--------|
| Interface Fa0/0 | Up/Up | Up/Up | ✓ OK |
| EIGRP neighbor R2 | Peer state | Down | ✗ FAULT |
| Route 10.5.0.0/16 | Present | Missing | ✗ FAULT |

---

## Hypothesis Template

```
Hypothesis: [e.g., "OSPF neighbor failing due to Hello timer mismatch"]
Test:        show ip ospf interface on both sides
Expected:    Matching hello/dead intervals
Actual:      R1 hello=10, R2 hello=20
Conclusion:  Confirmed — timer mismatch preventing adjacency
```

Iterate through hypotheses until root cause is confirmed.
