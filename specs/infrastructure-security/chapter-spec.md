# Infrastructure Security Chapter Spec

## Exam Bullets Covered

- 3.1 Troubleshoot device security using IOS AAA (TACACS+, RADIUS, local database)
- 3.2 Troubleshoot router security features
  - 3.2.a IPv4 access control lists (standard, extended, time-based)
  - 3.2.b IPv6 traffic filter
  - 3.2.c Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF)
- 3.3 Troubleshoot control plane policing (CoPP)
- 3.4 Describe IPv6 First Hop Security features (RA Guard, DHCP Guard, binding table, ND inspection/snooping, source guard)

## Planned Labs

<!-- Fill in before running chapter-topics skill -->

## Topology Requirements

<!-- Devices, links, addressing scheme -->

## Notes

- IPv6 First Hop Security (3.4) is describe-only — theory content
- AAA labs may need a RADIUS/TACACS+ server (freeradius container or simulated)
