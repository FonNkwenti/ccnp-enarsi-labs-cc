# Redistribution & Route Control Chapter Spec

## Exam Bullets Covered

- 1.4 Troubleshoot redistribution between any pair of routing protocols or instances
- 1.2 Troubleshoot route maps (attributes, tagging, filtering)
- 1.3 Troubleshoot loop prevention mechanisms (filtering, tagging, split horizon, route poisoning)
- 1.6 Configure and verify policy-based routing
- 1.7 Configure and verify VRF-Lite
- 1.8 Describe Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)

## Preferences

<!-- Optional — high-level constraints or requests. Leave blank for defaults. -->
<!-- Examples: "cover EIGRP↔OSPF and OSPF↔BGP redistribution pairs" -->

## Generated Plan

> Not yet generated. Run `chapter-topics` skill to populate this section.

## Notes

- BFD (1.8) is describe-only on the exam — theory content, not a full config lab
- Redistribution labs should follow EIGRP and OSPF chapters (requires prior knowledge)
